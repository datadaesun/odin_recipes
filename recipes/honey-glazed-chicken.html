    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I received this recipe from a friend of mine and have used this for years.
      My family requests this one often. It's a light meal that everyone will
      enjoy. Serve with steamed rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>
        2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk honey, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken in
        hot oil until lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Pour honey mixture into
        skillet and continue to cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in
        the center and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.
